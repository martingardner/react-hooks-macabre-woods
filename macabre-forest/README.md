This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose 
the purpose of this repo is to play around with react hooks by creating a fragment of a game mechanic using some of the new hooks such as useState, useContext, and useReducer as needed.

## Requirements
- What I will be creating is a small game fragment.  
- It will be composed of a max number of workers per turn, and will contain a text input that can reduce or add more workers to a given row.  
- Each row, aside from the input, will have a location that you are attaching workers too.
- There will be an activation button of some kind, it's purpose is to take the workers and generate the results of the locations
- lastly there will be a results panel that will list out the results of the workers going to each of those locations
- upon activation, when results are generated, the worker inputs should be cleared out (to simulate going into the next turn)

## Error Handling
- should not be able to go above max number of workers, and need to apply all workers before the activate button will function

## Todo List
- add in error handling so that more workers can't be added than the max allows
- add in error handling so that less than one worker can't exist
- add in activate button
- add in results panel to show results

## Install
- npm install
- cd to macabre woods
- npm run start
